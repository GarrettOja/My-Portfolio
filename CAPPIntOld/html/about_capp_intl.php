                            <p class="text10pt">My name is Dan Ewert and I believe the story is important because as your appraiser it is important that you understand, I see things through life of experience and hands on training. I bring this all to bear on your needs and requirements. No matter what your asset package consists of there is a good chance I have touched the application in some way. Either in a practical hands on way over the years or though another clients asset group.<br><br>My beginnings were in the construction business with my father from the late 50&#39;s. We plumbed allot of houses and commercial buildings in the Great North West. When Uncle Sam needed me in the early 70&#39;s the Air Force trained me in Electrical Power Production. I also served an additional 9 years in the Oregon Air National Guard after leaving the Air Force. I completed my BS Degree in Diesel Engineering with a co- minor in Industrial Education. With that experience I have worked for a number of companies including Peter Kewit, Caterpillar, Genstar, William Scotsman and others. I started working in the shop and worked my way up into management and a few years later owning and operating my own business&#39;s. The last of these business en-devours was sold to Freightliner Corporation in 1999.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>In 2000 I retired and decided to change careers. After a brief ownership as a partner in an electrical contracting company and working with a local auction company, I attended Western Collage of Auctioneering and became a Certified Auctioneer and then went on to become a Fully Trained Personal Property Appraiser.<br><br>That was 11 years ago and I am pleased to say that I am still doing what I love Appraisals and Auctioneering (liquidations). It has been a great run and I am now involved with over 150 auctions a year and appraising many millions of dollars worth of assets for banks, lending companies and private entities each year.<br><br>Thanks for walking with me through my story, I hope you made it all the way to the end. I look forward to meeting and talking with you some time soon. My company is built on the motto &#8220;Given good information our clients can make good and strong decisions&#8221; I would enjoy working with you!</p>
                            <p class="text10pt" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">                              I am a Fully Trained Personal Property Appraiser.                              A Personal Property Appraiser is a Professional                              Technician that is trained and has experience in                              what may be better termed as Asset Valuation.                              This would be tangible or non-tangible items such                              as equipment, tooling, antiques, or business                              assets such as customer base, inventory and                              accounts receivable.                              <br><br>This is not to be confused with a Real Property Appraiser which is a technician trained in the areas of Real Estate Appraisal (the building and the ground it sets on).&nbsp; <br><br>With my training, experience and diversified background in many different areas I can give you a real time asset valuation that can be used by lending institutions, company mergers, company down sizing, asset consolidation. The valuations that I produce are not just numbers pulled from the internet or sales periodicals but are also based on years of hands on experience working with many different types of equipment but also selling those assets in private treaty negotiations, seal bid and auction formats.<br><br>All of my appraisals are completed with in the USPAP guidelines for appraisers. The documentation that you will receive will present the assets in a understandable format. All reports include detailed information including descriptions, quantities, and model numbers, serial numbers and photo gallery of the majority of assets appraised. All documents are suitable for use for SBA Loan documentation, Bankruptcy or any type of court litigation. As a Trained Expert Witness for the Courts I develop documents that I personally can depend on if needed.</p>
