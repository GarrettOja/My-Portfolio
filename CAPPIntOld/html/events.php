                            Over 40 years ago a man with a passion for the cars
                            that were built when he was a boy began to collect.
                            Over the years he enjoyed all of the cars from the
                            1930&apos;s, 1940&apos;s, 1950&apos;s, and
                            1960&apos;s. All were Chevrolet&apos;s both cars and
                            trucks. There were many landmark historical events
                            that forever shaped our country the stock market
                            crash of 1929 and 50% unemployment. Drought first
                            hit the country in 1930. By 1934, it had turned the
                            Great Plains into a desert that came to be known as
                            the Dust Bowl. 1939 to 1945 saw our country in the
                            throws of WWII and as early as 1955 some of our
                            boys began to visit the jungles of Vietnam which of
                            course lasted to 1975. Our cars went from wood
                            frame to steel bodies, from boxy sedans to
                            streamline coupes and then shoe box gas misers.
                            <br><br>
                            Our client collected it all from barns and shops
                            all over America and on March 25, 2017 we will at
                            auction be offering his collection to collectors
                            all over the world. Below you will find a list of
                            vehicles offered and as we put this collection
                            together to offer it this list will be adjusted and
                            fine tuned into the final catalog that will be used
                            for the sale. Listed now below is the original list
                            we were given by the family and we will be adding
                            more detail as we get closer to the sale day we
                            have found that some vehicles were sold so some
                            adjustments need to be made. There are 3 barns and
                            garages on the property and about 50% of the list
                            has been stored in the barns for many years. There
                            are many original parts, body parts, engines,
                            fenders, bumpers, grills, hoods, doors, dash parts,
                            wheels, beds, axles  and over 50 radios and their
                            trim these will all be added as we lot them up. If
                            you have any questions please feel free to contact

There is only one way in and one way out and if it rains it will turn into a swamp down by the barns. Also the property is for sale and the family has asked us not to tear up the passage from the house to the barns. We also have a time limit of one week for removal. To manage this we have decided to work with a rigger for all non hand carry removal. This is an unusual situation but it must be to preserve the integrity of the property so here are the rules:<br>                          <ul>                            <li>There are two types of lots sold at this Auction <strong style:"text-decoration: underline;">&quot;HAND CARRY&quot;</strong> and <strong style:"text-decoration: underline;">&quot;RIGGED&quot;</strong></li>                            <li><strong style="font-style: italic;">HAND CARRY - This is defined as any item that a person can pick up by them selfs or with help that you provide and walked to your parked vehicle.</strong></li>                            <li><strong style="font-style: italic;">RIGGED - This will be the case with all non HAND CARRY ITEMS.</strong> Examples would be Cars that are not running, Motors, Frames, Cabs, Cars that are running but will be driven off site, etc.</li>                          </ul>                          <h4 class="white"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">RIGGED ITEMS: YOUR RECIPT MUST SHOW YOU HAVE PAID FOR THE RIGGING FEES BEFORE YOU HAVE THE RIGGER MOVE OR LOAD THE ITEMS.</strong></h4>                          <ul>                            <li>SMALLER RIGGED ITEMS WILL BE LOADED DIRECTLY ONTO YOUR TRUCK OR TRAILER STAGED IN THE FEILD NEXT TO THE SITE.</li>                            <li>LARGER RIGGED ITEMS WILL BE either scheduled to be delivered to your location by the rigger or moved and staged in the field in the parking area by the rigger for your pickup.</li>                            <li>Rigging immediately after the sale will be determined by the rigger and accessibility after the sale.</li>                            <li>Smaller items such as motors will not be staged in the field but must be place directly on your trailer or truck by the rigger.</li>                          </ul>                          <h3 style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><strong>PLEASE REMEMBER THERE WILL BE AN EXTRA FEE APPLIED TO ALL ITEMS BOUGHT THAT CAN NOT BE MOVED BY HAND.
