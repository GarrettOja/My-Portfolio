            <div class="mdl-card__supporting-text" id="phoneContent">
              <p>I started casually learning to code websites in the
                beginning of 2016. Starting with HTML/CSS, I gained a basic
                understanding of the workings of a website. I immediately
                fell in love with the idea that I can create anything
                I can imagine and put it online for the world to see.
                <br><br>
                My first project, fictional
                "Bakersfield Mobile Repair", taught me a lot about the entire
                process of building a website, from the design process,
                prototyping, mobile optimization, debugging, and server hosting.
                I briefly considered starting a mobile device repair business but
                quickly realized I enjoyed making websites a lot more than I
                liked fixing devices. It was at this point that I started to
                get serious about web development. I also gained my first client
                after having fixed their office sign-in iPad.
                <br><br>
                My second project, Bakersfield Family Chiropractic,
                taught me how to work with clients and build a
                more interactive website. With this project I began
                experimenting with Javascript DOM manipulation via my own
                functions and a little bit of jQuery as well. This website
                was also my first project to include different layouts
                for mobile and desktops/tablets to create a better looking
                user interface. If I were to do this project over again, I
                would use a lot less custom classes and instead make changes
                to the default Bootstrap classes. I've found that this makes it
                easier to maintain a consistant look across the website while
                keeping the classes used to a minimum.
                <br><br>
                My third project, CAPP International, was my first experience editing someone
                else's existing code. I enjoyed the challenge of making
                my content responsive on a website that was not well
                optimized for mobile. I also had the opportunity to
                build my own Javascript photo gallery generator so that I
                didn't have to manually add in 300+ images. The gallery
                script uses a simple naming convention so that the
                images can be easily swapped out in the future.
                <br><br>
                I recently had the opportunity to do a full rebuild of
                CAPP International. I cloned the look of the old site
                and used Bootstrap to make it responsive, with the added
                benefit of much less resources and quicker page loads.
                With the new website I am now able to change the content
                much easier without all the old, bloated HTML code of the
                previous version. I also divided each section of my pages into
                PHP Include files so I can make changes in one place instead of
                making the same changes on every page of the website.
                <br><br>
                Of course, let's not forget my portfolio website! My first
                version was built using Bootstrap and had very little options for
                interaction. Bootstrap is my favorite CSS framework but I wanted
                to try out Google's Material Design Lite CSS library because I
                liked the clean, simple look it was able to provide. With the
                new, current version I added page navigation, a collapsible section,
                better mobile optimization, and Google Analytics scripts. I'm
                sure I will eventually rebuild this again as I gain more
                knowledge and come up with fresh, new design ideas. I must
                note, as much as I like the look of Google MDL, it uses way
                too many class names that really clutter up the code. For this
                reason, I probably won't use MDL again unless it's for a small
                project.
                <br><br>
                I use Atom as my text editor. Chrome and it's mobile device emulator are
                used for my test environments. I use XAMPP as a local
                server when I'm using PHP. For my photo editing and illustrating,
                I use GIMP and Inkscape respectively. I'm also re-learning Adobe Photoshop
                and getting familiar with Adobe Illustrator. For batch resizing
                of images, I like to use Adobe Lightroom.
                <br><br>
                When I'm not coding, I'm either riding my motorcycle,
                driving my Jeep, or playing video games. I love
                to go adventuring in new places! I also do
                a little stock trading in my spare time.</p>

                  <p>I started casually learning to code websites in the
                    beginning of 2016. Starting with HTML/CSS, I gained a basic
                    understanding of the workings of a website. I immediately
                    fell in love with the idea that I can create anything
                    I can imagine and put it online for the world to see.
                    <br><br>
                    My first project, fictional
                    "Bakersfield Mobile Repair", taught me a lot about the entire
                    process of building a website, from the design process,
                    prototyping, mobile optimization, debugging, and server hosting.
                    I briefly considered starting a mobile device repair business but
                    quickly realized I enjoyed making websites a lot more than I
                    liked fixing devices. It was at this point that I started to
                    get serious about web development. I also gained my first client
                    after having fixed their office sign-in iPad.
                    <br><br>
                    My second project, Bakersfield Family Chiropractic,
                    taught me how to work with clients and build a
                    more interactive website. With this project I began
                    experimenting with Javascript DOM manipulation via my own
                    functions and a little bit of jQuery as well. This website
                    was also my first project to include different layouts
                    for mobile and desktops/tablets to create a better looking
                    user interface. If I were to do this project over again, I
                    would use a lot less custom classes and instead make changes
                    to the default Bootstrap classes. I've found that this makes it
                    easier to maintain a consistant look across the website while
                    keeping the classes used to a minimum.
                    </p>
                    <p id="more" style="display: none;">
                    My third project, CAPP International, was my first experience editing someone
                    else's existing code. I enjoyed the challenge of making
                    my content responsive on a website that was not well
                    optimized for mobile. I also had the opportunity to
                    build my own Javascript photo gallery generator so that I
                    didn't have to manually add in 300+ images. The gallery
                    script uses a simple naming convention so that the
                    images can be easily swapped out in the future.
                    <br><br>
                    I recently had the opportunity to do a full rebuild of
                    CAPP International. I cloned the look of the old site
                    and used Bootstrap to make it responsive, with the added
                    benefit of much less resources and quicker page loads.
                    With the new website I am now able to change the content
                    much easier without all the old, bloated HTML code of the
                    previous version. I also divided each section of my pages into
                    PHP Include files so I can make changes in one place instead of
                    making the same changes on every page of the website.
                    <br><br>
                    Of course, let's not forget my portfolio website! My first
                    version was built using Bootstrap and had very little options for
                    interaction. Bootstrap is my favorite CSS framework but I wanted
                    to try out Google's Material Design Lite CSS library because I
                    liked the clean, simple look it was able to provide. With the
                    new, current version I added page navigation, a collapsible section,
                    better mobile optimization, and Google Analytics scripts. I'm
                    sure I will eventually rebuild this again as I gain more
                    knowledge and come up with fresh, new design ideas. I must
                    note, as much as I like the look of Google MDL, it uses way
                    too many class names that really clutter up the code. For this
                    reason, I probably won't use MDL again unless it's for a small
                    project.
                    <br><br>
                    I use Atom as my text editor. Chrome and it's mobile device emulator are
                    used for my test environments. I use XAMPP as a local
                    server when I'm using PHP. For my photo editing and illustrating,
                    I use GIMP and Inkscape respectively. I'm also re-learning Adobe Photoshop
                    and getting familiar with Adobe Illustrator. For batch resizing
                    of images, I like to use Adobe Lightroom.
                    <br><br>
                    When I'm not coding, I'm either riding my motorcycle,
                    driving my Jeep, or playing video games. I love
                    to go adventuring in new places! I also do
                    a little stock trading in my spare time.</p>
