# My Portfolio

This is the second version of my portfolio 
website. My first version was built using 
Bootstrap and had very little options for 
interaction. Bootstrap is my favorite CSS 
framework but I wanted to try out Google's 
Material Design Lite CSS library because I 
liked the clean, simple look it was able to 
provide. With this version, I added page 
navigation, a collapsible section, better 
mobile optimization, and Google Analytics 
scripts. I'm sure I will eventually rebuild 
this again as I gain more knowledge and come 
up with fresh, new design ideas. I must 
note, as much as I like the look of Google 
MDL, it uses way too many class names that 
really clutter up the code. For this reason, 
I probably won't use MDL again unless it's 
for a small project.
